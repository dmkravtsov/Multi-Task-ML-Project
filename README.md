# Project Overview

This repository contains solutions for three distinct tasks:

1. **Island Counting Problem**: 
   - A solution for counting the number of islands in a matrix, where islands are represented by `1` and the ocean by `0`. The algorithm uses Depth-First Search (DFS) to identify and count the islands.

2. **Prediction Task with 53 Features**: 
   - A machine learning model that predicts a target variable based on 53 features. The task includes preprocessing the data, applying regression techniques, and evaluating model performance.

3. **MNIST Digit Classification**: 
   - A digit classification system for recognizing handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset. It includes three models: a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), a Random Forest classifier, and a Random model for random digit predictions.

Each task is implemented in separate scripts or modules within this repository.

## How to Use

- Each task can be run independently, and the relevant code for each problem is included in separate files.
- To run any of the solutions, simply execute the corresponding Python script.

## Requirements

- Ensure you have the necessary libraries installed, such as `numpy`, `pandas`, `scikit-learn`, `tensorflow`, and others depending on the specific task.
